By default, this library is not installed on the Anaconda Python distribution we're using in this course, hence you will need to install it first. To do so, open the console (``cmd.exe`` on Windows or the standard terminal on Linux or MacOS) and enter the following commands.\n",

    "Newton's method is one of the most widely used methods for finding solutions to systems of non-linear equations. It  converges at a remarkable speed when started sufficiently close to a root, though there is generally no strict guarantee of convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a function $f(x)$, Newton's method tries to find a solution to the equation $f = 0$ using steps of the form\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In other words: the unknowns are the angles $\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_n$, and the function whose root we seek maps to a two-dimensional domain. It is not immediately obvious how to apply Newton's method, since the Jacobian of the function has the shape $2\\times n$ and hence cannot be inverted using standard techniques like the LU decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should not be surprising. It is a consequence of the fact that many different configurations can be used to reach the same $p_{\\mathrm{target}}$, which you may have noticed in part 1.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we can use the *pseudoinverse*, a generalization of the inverse to non-square matrices. In this specific case, the Jacobian is *wide* (i.e. it has more columns than rows), in which case the pseudoinverse will find the solution to a linear system which has the smallest $\\|\\cdot\\|_2$-norm. That is excellent news, since it causes the IK solver to make small adjustments to the angles to reach a new position.\n",

The implementation should perform a fixed 8 iterations of Newton's method to try to solve the equation $p(\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_n) = p_{\\mathrm{target}}$ and return the final set of parameters $\\theta_1,\\ldots,\\theta_n$ as an 1-dimensional NumPy array.
